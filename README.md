# MovieReviewSystem
The main focus of this project was to provide a platform where movie lovers can come, discover new movies, come to get to know as to how
good or bad the movies are from the reviews assigned by previous commentors, comment on the movies and get recommendations.
Recommendations is based on similarity of users by collaborative filtering using Pearson's formula. In this case we show the user how the most similar user has commented on the movies he has watched and the ratings he has given both the 5 star ratings as well as 1 star ratings and give him the opportunity to pick up the movies he liked as well as avoid the lowly ranked ones
